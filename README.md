### 1. Introduction
Safety is our number one priority to us. Therefore, I would like to research the criminal case and rates in the U.S. 
The original data set contains the crime rates and totals for states across the United States for a wide range of years. The crime reports are divided into two main categories: property and violent crime. Property crime refers to burglary, larceny, and motor related crime while violent crime refers to assault, murder, rape, and robbery. The reports go from 1960 to 2019. The dataset has 2 categorical variables, 19 numeric variables, and 3115 observations.

I found the dataset from the CORGIS Data website. Here is the link to the dataset I have worked on: https://corgis-edu.github.io/corgis/csv/state_crime/ 

#### Cleaning and Changes
There were not any missing data in the dataset. 
I added the following 2 categorical variables to the original csv file.
    
	1. Region: West, Midwest, Northeast, South /Classified regions by Business Insider Website/
